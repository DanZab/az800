# AZ 800
This repo contains material related to the AZ 800 lessons from my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DanZabinski).

All material is based on the [AZ 800 Study Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-800).

If you have no already, watch my videos on how to configure a temporary Active Directory lab environment in Azure that you can use for the lab material:

1. (Optional) [Instant Active Directory Lab in Azure: Step-by-Step (Part 1)](https://youtu.be/lSTquhXO5kU?si=6T6iJ_doSuk1xrzQ)
2. [Instant Active Directory Lab in Azure: Step-by-Step (Part 2)](https://youtu.be/dlGQxzPiXsk?si=5aOc8nKmF3kmAH5v)

## How to use this material
Folders are structured to mirror the exam objectives/study guide. There are root directories for each subject, with subdirectories for each video under that section.

Each lesson folder has a few elements:

1. (Optional) A terraform directory with a sample deployment for you to deploy your own lab
2. A 'lab challenges' file that will provide a handful of lab scenarios for you to test your knowledge on.
2. A lesson quiz, that you should take after watching/reviewing the video and attempting the associated labs.
4. A solutions document that covers lab and quiz answers

Both documents will have links to the associated solutions or answers for you to review after you've complete them.
